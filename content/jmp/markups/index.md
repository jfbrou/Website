abstract: "We study the dynamic consequences of markups for long-run economic growth in a general equilibrium theory of firm-driven endogenous technological change. In this environment, differentiated firms engage in monopolistic competition, charge heterogeneous markups and make forward-looking investments in R&D to improve their process efficiency. Markups constrain the scale at which these firms operate and therefore distort their "market size" incentive to invest in R&D. With dispersion in markups, both the aggregate and cross-firm allocations of such investments are thus inefficient. Using firm-level administrative data from France to discipline our model, we find that transfers inciting firms to operate at the efficient scale increase the long-run growth rate of total-factor productivity by 1.5 percentage points. Our analysis shows that this faster productivity growth is achieved by eliminating the dispersion in markups rather than their average level."

We study the dynamic consequences of markups for long-run economic growth in a general equilibrium theory of firm-driven endogenous technological change. In this environment, differentiated firms engage in monopolistic competition, charge heterogeneous markups and make forward-looking investments in R&D to improve their process efficiency. Markups constrain the scale at which these firms operate and therefore distort their "market size" incentive to invest in R&D. With dispersion in markups, both the aggregate and cross-firm allocations of such investments are thus inefficient. Using firm-level administrative data from France to discipline our model, we find that transfers inciting firms to operate at the efficient scale increase the long-run growth rate of total-factor productivity by 1.5 percentage points. Our analysis shows that this faster productivity growth is achieved by eliminating the dispersion in markups rather than their average level.
